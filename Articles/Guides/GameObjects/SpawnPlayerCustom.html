<h1 id="custom-character-spawning">Custom Character Spawning</h1>

<p>MirrorNG comes with a PlayerSpawner which will automatically spawn a player object when a client connects.</p>
<p>Many games need character customization. You may want to pick the color of the hair, eyes, skin, height, race, etc.</p>
<p>In this case,  you will need to create your own PlayerSpawner.  Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create your player prefabs (as many as you need) and add them to the Spawnable Prefabs in your NetworkClient.</li>
<li>Create a message that describes your player. For example:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public struct CreateMMOCharacterMessage
{
    public Race race;
    public string name;
    public Color hairColor;
    public Color eyeColor;
}

public enum Race
{
    None,
    Elvish,
    Dwarvish,
    Human
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Create Player Spawner class and add it to some GameObject in your scene</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public class PlayerSpawner : MonoBehaviour
{
    public NetworkSceneManager SceneManager;
    public NetworkClient Client;
    public NetworkServer Server;
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Drag the NetworkClient and NetworkServer and Scene manager to the fields</li>
<li>Hook into events:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public virtual void Start()
{
    Client.Authenticated.AddListener(OnClientAuthenticated);
    Server.Authenticated.AddListener(OnServerAuthenticated);
}
    ```
6) Send your message with your character data when your client connects, or after the user submits his preferences.
``` cs
// you can send the message here if you already know
// everything about the character at the time of connection
// or at a later time when the user submits his preferences
private void OnClientAuthenticated(INetworkConnection connection)
{
    sceneManager.SetClientReady();

    var mmoCharacter = new CreateMMOCharacterMessage {
        // populare the message with your data
    }
    connection.Send(mmoCharacter)
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>Receive your message in the server and spawn the player</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">private void OnServerAuthenticated(INetworkConnection connection)
{
    // wait for client to send us an AddPlayerMessage
    connection.RegisterHandler&lt;CreateMMOCharacterMessage&gt;(OnCreateCharacter);
}

void OnCreateCharacter(INetworkConnection conn, CreateMMOCharacterMessage msg)
{
    // create your player object
    // use the data in msg to configure it
    GameObject playerObject = ...;

    // spawn it as the player object
    server.AddPlayerForConnection(conn, playerObject);
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="ready-state">Ready State</h2>
<p>In addition to players, client connections also have a “ready” state. The host sends clients that are ready information about spawned game objects and state synchronization updates; clients which are not ready are not sent these updates. When a client initially connects to a server, it is not ready. While in this non-ready state, the client can do things that don’t require real-time interactions with the game state on the server, such as loading Scenes, allowing the player to choose an avatar, or fill in log-in boxes. Once a client has completed all its pre-game work, and all its Assets are loaded, it can call <code>ClientScene.Ready</code> to enter the “ready” state. The simple example above demonstrates implementation of ready states; because adding a player with <code>NetworkServer.AddPlayerForConnection</code> also puts the client into the ready state if it is not already in that state.</p>
<p>Clients can send and receive network messages without being ready, which also means they can do so without having an active player game object. So a client at a menu or selection screen can connect to the game and interact with it, even though they have no player game object. See documentation on <a href="../Communications/NetworkMessages.html">Network Messages</a> for more details about sending messages without using RPC calls.</p>
<p>Note the ready state may be going away in the future.</p>
<h2 id="switching-players">Switching Players</h2>
<p>To replace the player game object for a connection, use <code>NetworkServer.ReplacePlayerForConnection</code>. This is useful for restricting the Server RPC Calls that players can issue at certain times, such as in a pregame room screen. This function takes the same arguments as <code>AddPlayerForConnection</code>, but allows there to already be a player for that connection. The old player game object does not have to be destroyed. The <code>NetworkRoomManager</code> uses this technique to switch from the <code>NetworkRoomPlayer</code> game object to a game play player game object when all the players in the room are ready.</p>
<p>You can also use <code>ReplacePlayerForConnection</code> to respawn a player or change the object that represents the player. In some cases it is better to just disable a game object and reset its game attributes on respawn. The following code sample demonstrates how to actually replace the player game object with a new game object:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public class MyNetworkManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public NetworkServer Server;

    public void ReplacePlayer(NetworkConnection conn, GameObject newPrefab)
    {
        // Cache a reference to the current player object
        GameObject oldPlayer = conn.identity.gameObject;

        // Instantiate the new player object and broadcast to clients
        kServer.ReplacePlayerForConnection(conn, Instantiate(newPrefab));

        // Remove the previous player object that's now been replaced
        Server.Destroy(oldPlayer);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If the player game object for a connection is destroyed, then that client cannot execute ServerRpc's. They can, however, still send network messages.</p>
<p>To use <code>ReplacePlayerForConnection</code> you must have the <code>NetworkConnection</code> game object for the player’s client to establish the relationship between the game object and the client. This is usually the property <code>connectionToClient</code> on the <code>NetworkBehaviour</code> class, but if the old player has already been destroyed, then that might not be readily available.</p>
<p>To find the connection, there are some lists available. If using the <code>NetworkRoomManager</code>, then the room players are available in <code>roomSlots</code>. The <code>NetworkServer</code> also has lists of <code>connections</code>.</p>
